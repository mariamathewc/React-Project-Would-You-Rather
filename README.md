<h2>About</h2>
This is a React application that was built as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. It is a recreation of the classic game, Would You Rather. The dashboard contains "unanswered" tab and "answered" tab. The "unanswered" tab leads to the questions that the user is yet to poll and "answered" tab leads to the poll result. Users are also allowed to create new questions which will be available to other users. The Leaderboard displays the rank of all the users. The state management is done using Redux library.
